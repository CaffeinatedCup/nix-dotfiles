My Personal NixOs Config

Issue:
 - Disconnects from internet after every restart
 - Asks for confirmation to close kitty every time
 - Does not have floating setting for hyprland, or any configuration
 - Waybar looks ugly and so does the fuzzel
 - Also need to reorganize configuration.nix and home.nix

Need to add:
- Support for more hosts
- basic features like bluetooth and sound
- Wallpaper for hyprland (swww)
- Gaming stuff
- Emacs and Neovim configs
- File managers
- Themes (gtk, maybe pywal, maybe nix colors)
- Zsh, tmux, and terminal stuff
- Browser configuration
- Secrets management
- SSH
